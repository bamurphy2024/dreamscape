## Chapter 7
She spoke to me quietly. First it was just coo-ing and humming, and the gentle vibrations I felt deep inside me caused me to slumber.

But sometimes those same sounds would awaken me, and the warmth I felt against me felt safe and secure. But sometimes the humming stopped, and the warmth went away, and I was cold. That made me feel things I didn't like and I became angry. 

As I grew she began to talk to me about the world outside, and I did not understand.

"I wonder what she means." I thought to myself. "What is *__outside__*"?

 "You will see soon enough, little one."

 "What is *__see__*"?

 "You see with your eyes."

 "What are eyes?"

 "You will see soon enough, little one."

 I laughed a little. I didn't know what laughter was then, but I know now.

 I slept.

 When I awoke I felt a great movement inside of me. It pulsed and throbbed and sizzled and cracked. I did not understand.

 "What is that?" I asked.

 But she did not respond.

 A long time passed.

 I felt the great movement again, and then she spoke.

 "I'm back, little one. A stranger came and I had to leave to protect you."

 "What is leave?"

 "When I go away from you. That is to leave."

 "I do not like that. It makes me feel..."

 "Cold?"

 "Yes."

 "I know. I am sorry, little one."

 "I felt strange things inside me when you were not with me. I felt them again right before you came back."

 "You *felt*, and then you *heard*, little one. Those were sounds. When you hatch you will hear many more sounds!"

 "What is hatch?"

 ## Chapter 8 

Many sleeps passed. I felt her leave again, and heard it. 

And I waited.

I grew colder.

And I waited more.

And I waited more.

I was so cold.

Then I *heard* a voice. It was not hers.

## Chapter 9

"There they are." Bez whispered, as she approached the clutch of eggs.
